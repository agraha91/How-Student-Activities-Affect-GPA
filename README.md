**Project Title:** Student Activities vs. GPA Analysis
**Completion Date:** June 2025

**Overview**
This project investigates the relationship between student participation in extracurricular activities and their academic performance, measured by GPA. The goal is to determine whether involvement in student activities positively, negatively, or neutrally correlates with academic success.

**Objectives**
- Explore whether students involved in more activities have higher GPAs
- Analyze trends across activity types, frequency, and academic majors
- Use regression and correlation analysis to quantify relationships
- Visualize findings to support actionable insights for academic support programs

**Methods**
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Summary statistics and group comparisons
- Correlation Analysis: Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
- Regression Modeling: Linear regression to test influence of activity participation
- Visualization: Box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts for comparison

**Technologies Used**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

**Key Findings**
- Moderate positive correlation found between number of activities and GPA
- Leadership roles in student organizations correlated more strongly with higher GPA than passive participation
- Overinvolvement (too many hours/week) showed diminishing academic returns
- Findings support the idea of balanced extracurricular engagement for optimal academic performance

**Ethical Considerations**
- Data was anonymized and used in aggregate form
- Care was taken to avoid reinforcing academic stereotypes based on involvement type
- Recommendations are intended for supportive guidance, not predictive filtering
